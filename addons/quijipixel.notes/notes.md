Roar: 1480 milli seconds should the sound last

Mechanics rules:
- The roar scares the enemies leaving them stun for a little while
- The roar destroys the on-air projectiles
- Enemies throw projectiles
- Big strong enemies may hit you
- Projectiles range from knives to bombs
- There are armed enemies, with machine guns
- Roar has to charge? so they don't go on a roaring rampage
- Tail whip whacks them
- Falling hard stun enemies too

Bosses:
- Tank army?
- Evil rat king and rat army?
- Evil ninja clan?
